# Battleship

## Workflow
* We decided to create a "Battleship" game, that would have two play options: 1) online PvP 2) standalone with bot.
* The base of the app was based on a previous work of Andrew's since it already had support of animation.
* Our application has a class-based structure.
* The tasks were divided into two major fields: front-end(Vi) and back-end(Andrew C., Andrew I., Alex)
* Andrew C. had worked on interface for message interchange between players.
* Vi had created an interface for drawing battlefields, and accessing and modifying cells of those fields.
* Andrew C. and Alex were implementing game logic functions working with field cells.
* Andrew I. created an abstract Player class that provides uniform interface for all types of players, i.e. local player, virtual player(bot) and remote player

## About application
The application we planned to create has a purpose of giving users a possibility to enjoy game of "Battleship" without regard whether it's a standalone game with a bot or a Internet game. The interface would be simple and intuitive for any player. 

##Objectives accomplished
* Work on this project in a team of 2-4 **(2 pt)** (team of four people)
  * Divide tasks and describe them in readme (for each task indicate who is responsible for it) **(1 pt)** (Vi had to work on front-end, Andrew C., Andrew I. and Alex worked on back-end)
* Make it useful (you may ask me to evaluate usefulness of your application idea) **(0-3 pt)** (This game is an useful application for those who'd like to spend some time playing BBatleship without ruining paper, or would like to play remotely with a friend, moreover it is useful for developers)
* The concept of an online game is quite complex, and the team had to cocer more topics/issues
